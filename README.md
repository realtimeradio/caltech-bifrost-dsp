```

Download this package and add the following to your `~/.vimrc` file:

```
source /path/to/vim_py3_rst/plugin/vim_py3_rst.vim
```

Now, in vim `\etf` and `\etr` can be used to format and reformat, respectively, rst standard tables.
This is _very_ useful when dealing with all the docstring tables!

This package requires the python libraries (available from `pip`) `stpl` and `rstdoc`
